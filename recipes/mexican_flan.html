        <p> This Mexican flan recipe was given to me by my mother-in-law, who is from Durango, Mexico. <br />
            I had to beg her for years to give me this custard recipe â€” she finally gave it to me one Christmas. <br />
            I added orange zest, but the original dessert recipe calls for just pure vanilla. You can also use almond extract. </p>
