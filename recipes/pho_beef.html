            <li> ½ pound frozen beef sirloin </li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Directions </h2>
        <ol>
            <li> <strong>Step 1</strong>: Place beef bones in a 9-quart (or larger) pot; season with 1 teaspoon salt. 
                Pour water into the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer broth for about 2 hours. </li>
            <li> <strong>Step 2</strong>: Meanwhile, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
                Line a 10x15-inch roasting pan with aluminum foil. </li>
            <li> <strong>Step 3</strong>: Place onions and unpeeled ginger onto the prepared roasting pan and cook under the preheated broiler, 
                stirring occasionally, until vegetables are charred, 10 to 15 minutes. </li>
            <li> <strong>Step 4</strong>: Cool slightly. Chop onions, then peel and slice ginger; set aside separately. </li>
            <li> <strong>Step 5</strong>: Skim fat from surface of simmering broth. Add oxtail, radish, and charred onions to broth. 
                Tie charred ginger, anise, cinnamon stick, peppercorns, and cloves in cheesecloth to make a bouquet garni; add to broth. 
                Stir in sugar, fish sauce, and remaining 2 teaspoons salt. Simmer over medium-low heat for at least 4 hours (the longer, the better). 
                Season with salt. </li>
            <li> <strong>Step 6</strong>: Strain broth. Discard bones and bouquet garni. Reserve meat from bones for another use. 
                Chill broth in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight. </li>
            <li> <strong>Step 7</strong>: Skim and discard fat from the top of chilled broth. Pour broth into a pot; bring to a boil. 
                Reduce heat and keep hot until ready to serve. </li>
            <li> <strong>Step 8</strong>: Bring a pot of water to a boil. Turn off heat. Stir in rice noodles and let sit until noodles are tender yet chewy,
                 6 to 10 minutes. </li>
            <li> <strong>Step 9</strong>: Meanwhile, cut frozen sirloin into paper-thin slices. </li>
            <li> <strong>Step 10</strong>: Drain and divide noodles among bowls, about 1 1/2 cups per serving. Top each with a few sirloin slices. 
                Ladle hot broth over sirloin and noodles. </li>
            <li> <strong>Step 11</strong>: Serve and enjoy! </li>
        </ol>
